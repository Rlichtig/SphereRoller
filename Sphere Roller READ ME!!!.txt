This is just the basic version of the game. If you want more levels and custom skins for the game, then you must buy them each for 5 dollars DLC. We will probably add more levels over Spring Break before the presentation is done, so you should focus on the mechanics and try to complete the game! :)
Good Luck and Have Fun!
